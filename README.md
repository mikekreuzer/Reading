# Reading

Reading was a minimal RSS/Atom feed reader written in JavaScript/Node.

It was a test of an idea and of Node. It may come back in Elixir. Maybe.

See one of the earlier tags for [the code](https://github.com/mikekreuzer/Reading/tree/Final), cleaned up here in case anyone's still counting lines of code by language.
